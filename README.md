# App Naming
**1. Gateway**

- StellarGate – A gateway is the entry point, and "stellar" implies something important or central, like the gateway to the stars.
- PortalCore – A portal is a gateway, and "core" suggests its central role in the architecture.

**2. Configuration**

- ConfigNova – A "nova" represents a transformative event, which fits well for a service responsible for dynamic configurations.
- SolsticeConfig – Drawing from the solstice, an event that brings significant change, it symbolizes flexible or shifting configurations.

**3. Discovery**

- OrbitDiscovery – Just as celestial bodies are discovered in orbits, this service could represent a discovery system for finding resources.
- PulsarSeek – Pulsars are objects that emit signals in a regular, detectable way, which aligns with the concept of discovering and finding services in a network.

**4. Extras**

- LunarExtras – "Lunar" relates to the moon, often viewed as supplementary or extra in the context of Earth's environment.
- AstroAddon – "Astro" refers to space or celestial bodies, while "addon" conveys additional or supplementary functionality.

**5. Authentication**

- SolarAuth – The sun is the center of our solar system, symbolizing centrality and importance, much like authentication for security.
- NebulaSecure – Nebulas are vast, mysterious, and secure in the vastness of space, a fitting name for a security microservice.

**6. Logging**

- StellarLog – Logging as a central system of tracking events, with "stellar" symbolizing the importance and visibility of these records.
- AstroTrace – "Astro" suggests something vast, while "Trace" indicates the service’s purpose to track and log events.

**7. Messaging/Queue**

- CometQueue – Like a comet's tail, this represents the flow of messages or data across the system.
- MeteorStream – "Meteor" refers to a fast-moving object, ideal for high-speed messaging systems.

**8. Database**
- GalacticDB – "Galactic" suggests vastness, just as your database might need to store vast amounts of data.
- PlanetaryStore – Referring to the system's role in storing large amounts of data, just as planets store resources.

**9. Analytics**

- CosmicAnalytics – A cosmic scale of data analysis, representing wide-ranging insights and patterns.
- StellarInsights – "Stellar" implying important or significant, fitting for a service providing analytics.

**10. Notification**

- SolarPulse – Referring to the pulsing energy from the sun, indicating a service that sends notifications or alerts.
- OrbitNotify – Drawing from the orbit of celestial objects, it conveys the movement of information through your notification system.

**11. Rate Limiting**

- EclipseThrottle – An eclipse is an event that momentarily limits light, akin to the role of rate limiting in restricting traffic.
- AstroControl – "Astro" represents the cosmic scale of control and regulation in this service.

**12. Load Balancer**

- EquinoxBalance – The equinox represents a balance of day and night, symbolizing load balancing between resources.
- OrbitBalancer – Just as planets orbit in balance, this service maintains equilibrium in system resources.

**13. Service Registry**

- CelestialRegistry – "Celestial" implies something important and organized, like a registry keeping track of services.
- StarMapRegistry – A star map helps navigate the sky, just as a service registry helps navigate your microservices.

**14. Metrics**

- NebulaMetrics – Like a nebula’s vast measurement of stars, this service could track vast amounts of data for metrics.
- SolarMetrics – Just as the solar system can be studied for various metrics, this service would track system performance and health.

**15. Health Check**

- AstralCheck – "Astral" refers to stars, which could symbolize a vital check of your system’s health.
- LunarPulse – Pulses from the moon could symbolize system health checks.

**16. Backup**

- SaturnVault – Saturn has its vast and protective rings, suggesting security and backup for your data.
- CosmosBackup – "Cosmos" represents the entire universe, much like the backup of an entire system.

**17. Security**

- MarsShield – Mars is often viewed as the "warrior" planet, representing protection and security.
- AetherGuard – "Aether" as the mythical substance of the universe, guarding the entirety of a system.

**18. Payment**
- JupiterPay – Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system, representing a central and authoritative service for payments.
- VenusCoin – Venus is known for being close to Earth, and its name could evoke the ease and closeness of payment systems.

**19. Search**

- CometSearch – Like a comet blazing across the sky, this service would provide fast and dynamic searching.
- NebulaSeek – A vast nebula represents an expansive, deep-search service that digs through data.

**20. API Gateway**

- CosmosGate – Representing a gateway to a larger universe, a perfect metaphor for an API gateway service.
- OrbitHub – "Orbit" suggests movement and interconnection, representing the central hub for routing APIs.
These names provide an astronomical and planetary touch while keeping the functionality of each microservice in mind. Let me know if you need more suggestions!
